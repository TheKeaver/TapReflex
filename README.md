# TapReflex
Final project game called "Tap Reflex" for iOS App Development course

Recent updates to XCode have rendered this project unable to be run. While an update to this code to get it running is preferable I
cannot guarantee this will get updated anytime soon. For now this project will serve as an example of experience with Swift/XCode and
app development in general.
